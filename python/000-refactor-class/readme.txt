Examine the example.py file.  Create a new file called singlepoleiir.py and in it
create a class called SinglePoleIIR.

This class's constructor should have a single parameter which is the "memory factor"
The class should have 3 methods: 

update(a) # does not return

get()  # returns 

update_get(a) # returns

The first update() to the class should initialize the filter with that value.
